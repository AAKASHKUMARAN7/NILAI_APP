part: Case Law
keywords: ADM Jabalpur, habeas corpus, emergency, 1976, Article 21, detention, fundamental rights, suspension, overruled, Puttaswamy
---

During the 1975-77 Emergency, the Supreme Court in a notorious 4:1 majority held that during a National Emergency, when the right to move court under Article 21 is suspended, no person has locus standi to challenge detention. Only Justice H.R. Khanna dissented, holding that the right to life cannot be taken away even during Emergency. This judgment was widely criticized and is considered the darkest hour of the Indian judiciary. It was effectively overruled by the Puttaswamy judgment (2017), where a 9-judge bench unanimously held that Justice Khanna's dissent was correct. The 44th Amendment (1978) subsequently ensured that Articles 20 and 21 can never be suspended during Emergency.

part: Case Law
keywords: Olga Tellis, right to livelihood, pavement dwellers, slum, eviction, Article 21, right to life, Mumbai, 1985
---

The Supreme Court held that the right to livelihood is part of the right to life under Article 21. Pavement dwellers cannot be evicted without following due process. The Court held that deprivation of livelihood would amount to deprivation of life and that no person can be deprived of their livelihood except by procedure established by law which is fair, just and reasonable. While the State can evict encroachers, it must follow due process, give notice, and consider rehabilitation. This case significantly expanded the scope of Article 21 to include economic and social rights.

part: Case Law
keywords: Mohini Jain, right to education, Article 21, capitation fee, medical college, 1992, fundamental right
---

The Supreme Court held that the right to education flows from the right to life under Article 21. The Court declared capitation fees charged by private medical colleges as arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 21. Justice Kuldip Singh held that the right to education is a fundamental right because without education, a person cannot exercise other fundamental rights. This laid the groundwork for Article 21A (Right to Education) inserted by the 86th Amendment (2002).

part: Case Law

---

The Supreme Court partly modified Mohini Jain, holding that the right to education under Article 21 is available to children up to age 14 (as indicated by Article 45 DPSP). Beyond 14, the right depends on the economic capacity of the State. Private educational institutions can charge reasonable fees but not capitation fees. This case directly influenced the 86th Amendment (2002) which inserted Article 21A guaranteeing free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14.

part: Case Law
keywords: D.K. Basu, custodial rights, arrest, detention, police, guidelines, custody, torture, death, 1997, Article 21, Article 22
---

The Supreme Court laid down 11 mandatory guidelines to be followed during arrest and detention to prevent custodial violence and death: (1) police must wear clear identification; (2) a memo of arrest must be prepared, attested by a witness and countersigned by the arrestee; (3) the arrestee has the right to inform a friend/relative; (4) if the friend/relative is outside the district, police must inform within 8-12 hours through the concerned police station; (5) the arrestee must be informed of these rights; (6) an entry in the diary at the place of detention; (7) medical examination at the time of arrest; (8) the arrestee must be examined by a trained doctor every 48 hours during detention; (9) copies of arrest documents sent to Magistrate; (10) the arrestee can meet their lawyer during interrogation; (11) a police control room displayed at all police stations. These guidelines are now law and violation can lead to contempt of court and compensation.

---

The Supreme Court held that bonded labour is a violation of Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution. The Court directed the State to identify, release, and rehabilitate bonded labourers working in stone quarries. The Court expanded the scope of Article 21 to include the right to live with human dignity, which includes protection from exploitation. The Court also relaxed procedural rules for PIL, allowing letters from citizens to be treated as writ petitions. The landmark principle established: wherever bonded labour is found, Article 21 is violated and the State must take immediate remedial action.

part: Case Law
keywords: Bachan Singh, death penalty, rarest of rare, capital punishment, Article 21, 1980, murder, sentencing
---

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the death penalty but established the "rarest of rare" doctrine — death sentence should be imposed only when the alternative option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed. The Court said the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be drawn, and courts must give special reasons for imposing death. Aggravating factors include: murder committed in an extremely brutal manner, murder for gain, murder of public servant, multiple murders. Mitigating factors include: young age, no prior criminal record, possibility of reform, mental condition, provocation. The subsequent Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983) further elaborated the categories for "rarest of rare."

part: Case Law
keywords: S.R. Bommai, Article 356, President's Rule, judicial review, secularism, basic structure, floor test, governor, 1994
---

In this landmark 9-judge bench decision, the Court laid down critical constitutional principles: (1) Secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution. (2) The power under Article 356 is not absolute and is subject to judicial review. (3) The President's (i.e., Union Government's) satisfaction must be based on relevant material. (4) The State Assembly should not be dissolved until both Houses of Parliament approve the Proclamation. If it is dissolved before approval and Parliament disapproves, the Court can restore the dismissed government. (5) The proper test for determining whether a government has the confidence of the House is the floor test, not the Governor's subjective assessment. (6) A State government following policies contrary to the Constitution's secular character can be dismissed. (7) Federalism is a basic structure principle, and Article 356 must not be used to subvert it. This case dramatically reduced the political misuse of Article 356.

---

A 9-judge bench held that laws placed in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973 (the date of the Kesavananda Bharati judgment) are subject to judicial review if they violate the basic structure of the Constitution or the fundamental rights that form part of it. The Court thereby limited the blanket immunity from judicial review that the Ninth Schedule provided, holding that it constitutes part of the basic structure doctrine that Parliament cannot use the Ninth Schedule as a device to abrogate fundamental rights.

---

An 11-judge bench dealt with the rights of minority and non-minority educational institutions. Key holdings: (1) Both linguistic and religious minorities are protected under Article 30. (2) Minority status is to be determined at the state level, not national level. (3) Unaided private institutions (minority and non-minority) have the right to admit students of their choice. (4) Professional unaided institutions may have their own admission procedure, but it must be fair, transparent, and merit-based. (5) Aided institutions must follow government reservation norms. (6) Minority institutions have greater autonomy than non-minority institutions but not unlimited autonomy.

---

The Supreme Court declared transgender persons as the "third gender," affirming their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 16, 19, and 21. Key holdings: (1) Transgender persons have the right to decide their self-identified gender. (2) The Centre and States must grant legal recognition of gender identity as male, female, or third gender. (3) Transgender persons are entitled to reservation as socially and educationally backward classes. (4) The State must take steps to treat them as backward for education and employment. This led to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, though the Act has been criticized for removing the self-identification principle.

---

A five-judge Constitution Bench unanimously struck down Section 497 IPC which criminalized adultery. The Court held that Section 497 was discriminatory because: (1) it treated a woman as the "property" of her husband; (2) only men could be prosecuted, not women; (3) it violated Articles 14, 15 and 21; (4) it was based on patriarchal notions incompatible with constitutional morality. CJI Misra held that Section 497 treated women as "chattel" of their husbands. The Court clarified that while adultery is no longer a criminal offence, it continues to be a ground for civil remedy (divorce). This judgment reinforced the principles of gender equality and individual autonomy.

---

While examining the internet shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, the Supreme Court held that: (1) Freedom of speech and expression through the internet is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). (2) The freedom to practice any profession through the internet is protected under Article 19(1)(g). (3) Internet suspension orders must satisfy the test of proportionality under Article 19(2)/(6). (4) Such orders must be published for public scrutiny and cannot be indefinite. (5) The government must conduct periodic review of such orders. This was the first time the Supreme Court explicitly recognized access to the internet as a fundamental right.

---

The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which criminalized sending "offensive" messages through computer or communication devices. The Court held that Section 66A was unconstitutionally vague and violated Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech). The terms "annoying," "inconvenient," "grossly offensive" were not defined and had a chilling effect on free speech. The Court upheld Section 69A (government power to block websites in the interest of sovereignty, security etc.) but with procedural safeguards. This case established important principles for online free speech in India.

---

A 5-judge bench upheld the Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid but with significant safeguards: (1) Aadhaar is mandatory for filing income tax returns and getting PAN. (2) Aadhaar cannot be mandated by private companies for services — linking Aadhaar to bank accounts, mobile phones etc. was struck down. (3) Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act (allowing private entities to use Aadhaar) was struck down. (4) The Court applied the proportionality test and held that while Aadhaar for welfare delivery passes the test, its use by private entities is disproportionate. (5) The authentication data can be stored for only 6 months. (6) No Aadhaar for children for school admission. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud dissented, arguing that the entire Aadhaar framework is unconstitutional as it enables mass surveillance.

---

The most comprehensive case on reservation. A 9-judge bench held: (1) 27% reservation for OBCs is valid. (2) Total reservation cannot exceed 50% (subject to extraordinary situations). (3) "Creamy layer" among OBCs must be excluded — economically advanced persons in backward classes don't need reservation. (4) Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but a facet of it. (5) Caste can be the starting point for identifying backward classes but not the sole criterion — social, educational, and economic factors must be considered. (6) Reservation applies only to initial appointment, not promotions (later overturned by 85th Amendment). (7) No reservation in promotions (later changed by 77th and 85th Amendments). (8) Backwardness must be social and educational, not just economic. (9) A permanent body should be constituted to examine inclusion/exclusion of classes (later became NCBC).

---

A 5-judge Constitution Bench (3:2) upheld the 103rd Amendment providing 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in public employment and educational institutions. The majority held: (1) Economic criterion alone can be a basis for reservation. (2) Exclusion of SC/ST/OBC from EWS quota is not discriminatory as they already have their own reservation. (3) The 50% ceiling set in Indra Sawhney does not apply to EWS reservation as it is a separate class. (4) The amendment does not violate basic structure. Justice Bhat and Justice Lalit dissented, holding that the exclusion of SC/ST/OBC from EWS creates a constitutionally untenable distinction among economically poor persons.

---

A 5-judge Constitution Bench legalized passive euthanasia and recognized the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21. The Court laid down guidelines for "living wills" (advance directives) whereby a person can specify that they do not want to be kept alive by life-support if they are in a permanent vegetative state or terminally ill. A Living Will must be signed by the executor in the presence of two attesting witnesses and countersigned by a Judicial Magistrate. The decision to withdraw life support must be approved by medical boards and the High Court. Active euthanasia and assisted suicide remain illegal.

---

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of criminal defamation under Sections 499 and 500 IPC. The Court held that the right to reputation is a fundamental right under Article 21 and is also a reasonable restriction on free speech under Article 19(2). The Court rejected the argument that civil remedies are sufficient and criminal defamation is excessive. Reputation was held to be an inseparable component of the right to life, both of natural and juristic persons. The Court emphasized that free speech is not an absolute right and must be balanced with the right to reputation.

The Supreme Court held that the right to choose one's life partner is a fundamental right under Articles 19 and 21. The Court set aside the Kerala High Court's annulment of Hadiya's marriage, holding that neither the High Court nor the parents have the authority to decide whom an adult can marry. CJI Misra stated: "The expression of choice in accord with law is acceptance of individual identity. Curtailing choice is refusal to accept the right of a person to live according to her choice." The judgment affirmed that conversion for the purpose of marriage and inter-faith marriages are constitutionally protected choices.

A 5-judge bench (4:1) held that the ban on entry of women aged 10-50 into Sabarimala temple is unconstitutional, violating Articles 14, 15, and 25. The majority held that exclusion based on menstrual status is a form of untouchability and cannot be considered an "essential religious practice." Justice Malhotra dissented, holding that the Court should not interfere with essential religious practices. A review petition was referred to a larger bench (pending as of 2024) to consider the broader question: what is the extent of judicial review of religious practices?

part: Case Law
keywords: Kedar Nath, sedition, Section 124A, IPC, free speech, incitement, violence, public disorder, Article 19, 1962
---

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the sedition law (Section 124A IPC) but significantly narrowed its scope. The Court held that sedition applies only to acts involving incitement to violence or tendency to create public disorder. Mere criticism of the government, howsoever strongly worded, does not amount to sedition so long as it does not incite violence or public disorder. The Court distinguished between "disloyalty" (which is not sedition) and "incitement to violence" (which is). Note: In 2022, the Supreme Court stayed the operation of Section 124A pending government reconsideration. Under BNS, sedition has been replaced by Section 152 (acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India), which is narrower in scope.

---

A 5-judge Constitution Bench held that the exercise of parliamentary privileges is subject to judicial review. In the "cash-for-questions" scandal where 11 MPs were expelled for accepting bribes to ask questions in Parliament, the Court upheld the expulsion but established the principle that parliamentary actions, even those based on privilege, must comply with fundamental rights. The Court held that while Parliament has wide privileges, they are not absolute and cannot violate the basic structure of the Constitution.

---

The Supreme Court struck down Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which allowed convicted legislators to remain in office by filing an appeal within 3 months. The Court held that Section 8(4) was violative of Article 14 as it created an unreasonable distinction between ordinary citizens (who are immediately disqualified upon conviction) and elected representatives (who could continue despite conviction). Post this judgment, any MP or MLA convicted and sentenced to not less than 2 years imprisonment stands immediately disqualified from the date of conviction.
