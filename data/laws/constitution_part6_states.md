part: Part VI

---

Money Bills can only be introduced in the Legislative Assembly. The Governor causes the annual financial statement (State Budget) to be laid before the Legislature. The Governor may promulgate ordinances when the Legislature is not in session if satisfied that circumstances exist which require immediate action (Article 213). Such ordinances have the same force as an Act of the Legislature and must be laid before the Legislature when it reassembles. If not approved within six weeks of reassembly, the ordinance ceases to operate. The Supreme Court in D.C. Wadhwa v. State of Bihar (1987) held that re-promulgation of ordinances without placing them before the Legislature is unconstitutional.

During emergency, Parliament can legislate on State List subjects.

No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. This article was inserted by the 44th Amendment (1978) when the right to property was removed from Fundamental Rights.

The Supreme Court has held that deprivation must be by valid law, must be for a public purpose, and must provide for fair compensation. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 requires: social impact assessment, consent of 80% of landholders for private projects and 70% for PPP projects, compensation at 2-4 times market value, and mandatory rehabilitation.
