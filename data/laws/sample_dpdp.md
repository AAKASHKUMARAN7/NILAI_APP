The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 is India's first comprehensive data protection law. It establishes a framework for processing digital personal data. Key concepts: Data Principal (the individual whose data is collected), Data Fiduciary (the entity that processes personal data), and the Data Protection Board of India (regulatory body). The Act applies to digital personal data processed within India, and to processing outside India if it involves offering goods/services to Data Principals in India. It gives citizens the right to access their data, right to correction and erasure, right to grievance redressal, and right to nominate. Penalties for violations can be up to Rs 250 crore.
