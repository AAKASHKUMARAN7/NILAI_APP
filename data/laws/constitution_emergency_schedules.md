title: Article 352 - National Emergency — Detailed Provisions and Safeguards
part: Part XVIII
keywords: national emergency, war, aggression, armed rebellion, fundamental rights, suspension, 44th amendment, written recommendation, cabinet, safeguards
---

A Proclamation of Emergency under Article 352 must be based on the written recommendation of the Cabinet (44th Amendment requirement — not just PM's advice). The Proclamation must be approved by both Houses of Parliament by special majority (2/3 of members present and voting) within one month. Once approved, it remains in force for six months and can be extended by six months at a time with Parliament's approval. During National Emergency: Article 19 freedoms are automatically suspended for matters related to the emergency. The President can suspend the right to move courts for enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 359 (except Articles 20 and 21 which can NEVER be suspended — 44th Amendment, 1978). Lok Sabha's term can be extended by one year at a time. Parliament can legislate on State List subjects. A minimum of 1/10th of total Lok Sabha members can move a resolution for disapproval. National Emergency has been proclaimed three times: 1962 (China war), 1971 (Pakistan war), and 1975-77 (internal emergency).

title: Article 356 - President's Rule — Detailed Provisions, Abuse, and Judicial Safeguards
part: Part XVIII
keywords: president's rule, state emergency, governor report, failure of constitutional machinery, state assembly, dissolution, judicial review, S.R. Bommai, misuse
---

Article 356 enables the President to impose President's Rule in a State if satisfied (on Governor's report or otherwise) that the State government cannot function per the Constitution. Effects: President assumes State executive functions, State Legislature's powers are exercised by Parliament, the President can take any necessary incidental provisions. Duration: initially 2 months, extendable by 6 months with Parliament's approval, maximum 3 years (extension beyond 1 year requires: National Emergency in operation, or Election Commission certifies elections cannot be held). The S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994) judgment imposed critical safeguards: (1) judicial review of President's satisfaction is permissible; (2) the State Assembly should not be dissolved until Parliament approves; (3) floor test is the proper method to determine majority, not Governor's subjective assessment; (4) secularism is a basic feature and anti-secular governance can justify Article 356. President's Rule has been imposed over 130 times, many times for political reasons. After Bommai, misuse has significantly reduced.

part: Part XVIII
keywords: suspension, fundamental rights, Article 19, article 358, article 359, emergency, cannot be suspended, Article 20, Article 21, 44th amendment
---

Article 358: While a Proclamation of Emergency declaring threat of war or external aggression is in operation, Article 19 freedoms are automatically suspended — but ONLY for matters connected with the emergency, not otherwise (44th Amendment). Article 359: During any Emergency, the President may by order suspend the right to move courts for enforcement of fundamental rights (except Articles 20 and 21). This is critical — the 44th Amendment ensured that even during the darkest emergency, the right to life and liberty (Article 21) and protection against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy (Article 20) can NEVER be suspended. This was a direct response to the ADM Jabalpur case (1976) where the Supreme Court had controversially held that even the right to life could be suspended during Emergency.

title: Article 368 - Amendment Procedure — Three Categories and Basic Structure
part: Part XX
keywords: amendment, procedure, simple majority, special majority, ratification, basic structure, constituent power, rigid, flexible
---

The Constitution provides three categories of amendments: (1) Simple Majority — certain provisions can be amended by ordinary law of Parliament (e.g., admission of new states, creation of Legislative Councils, citizenship). (2) Special Majority — most provisions require 2/3 majority of members present and voting AND majority of total membership of each House (e.g., Fundamental Rights, DPSPs). (3) Special Majority + Ratification — certain provisions additionally require ratification by at least half the State Legislatures (e.g., election of President, distribution of legislative powers, representation of States, Article 368 itself, Seventh Schedule). The Basic Structure Doctrine (Kesavananda Bharati, 1973) limits this power — Parliament cannot destroy the Constitution's basic structure. Basic structure includes: supremacy of Constitution, rule of law, separation of powers, judicial review, federalism, secularism, democratic republic, sovereignty, dignity of individual, unity and integrity, free and fair elections, and the essence of fundamental rights.

---

The Tenth Schedule (added by 52nd Amendment, 1985 and modified by 91st Amendment, 2003) provides for disqualification of members on grounds of defection. A member shall be disqualified if: (a) they voluntarily give up membership of their political party; or (b) they vote or abstain from voting contrary to the direction (whip) issued by the party. Exception: If not less than two-thirds of the members of a legislative party merge with another party, it is not counted as defection (the original "split" exemption for 1/3 was removed by 91st Amendment). The decision on disqualification is made by the Chairman/Speaker of the House. The Supreme Court in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu (1992) upheld the anti-defection law but held that the Speaker's decision is subject to judicial review. In Nabam Rebia v. Deputy Speaker (2016), the SC held that the Speaker cannot decide disqualification while a no-confidence motion against them is pending.
