This was a major reorganization creating 14 States and 6 Union Territories based largely on linguistic boundaries.

The 24th Amendment (1971) affirmed Parliament's power to amend any part of the Constitution including Fundamental Rights. It was enacted to overcome the Golaknath judgment (1967) which had held that Parliament cannot amend Fundamental Rights. The amendment added clause (4) to Article 13 stating that nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment under Article 368, and amended Article 368 to explicitly state Parliament's constituent power to amend any provision. The President shall assent to such amendments (cannot withhold).

It inserted Article 31C which gave primacy to Directive Principles in Articles 39(b) and (c) over Fundamental Rights in Articles 14 and 19. The Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati (1973) upheld the first part of Article 31C but struck down the second part that barred judicial review.

A member of Parliament or State Legislature is disqualified if they voluntarily give up membership of their party or vote/abstain contrary to party WhipP. The deciding authority is the Speaker/Chairman. Originally, a "split" exemption allowed 1/3 of members to break away without disqualification — this was removed by the 91st Amendment (2003), now requiring 2/3 for a valid "merger."

The Lieutenant Governor acts as the administrator. The Supreme Court in Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India (2018) held that the LG is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except in matters of land, police, and public order.

The 91st Amendment (2003) made two significant changes: (1) The total number of Ministers (including PM at Centre or CM at State) shall not exceed 15% of the total members of the Lower House. This was to prevent bloated ministries created for political patronage. (2) Modified the Tenth Schedule — removed the "split" paragraph that allowed 1/3 of members to break away without disqualification. Now, only a "merger" (minimum 2/3 of the party's members) is exempted from anti-defection.

---

The 97th Amendment (2011) gave constitutional status to cooperative societies by inserting Part IXB (Articles 243ZH to 243ZT).

Provisions include: voluntary formation and democratic functioning of cooperatives, term of 5 years for boards, regular elections, reservation for SC/ST and women, professional management, independent audit, right of members to access information, and offences and penalties for manipulation. However, in Union of India v. Rajendra N. Shah (2023), the Supreme Court struck down Part IXB as unconstitutional because it was passed without ratification by State Legislatures (cooperatives being a State subject).

---

The 99th Amendment (2014) sought to replace the Collegium system of judicial appointments with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) comprising the CJI, two senior SC judges, the Law Minister, and two eminent persons. However, the Supreme Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (2015) struck down the NJAC Act and the 99th Amendment as unconstitutional, holding that the NJAC violated the independence of the judiciary, which is part of the basic structure. The Collegium system (established by the Three Judges Cases — 1982, 1993, 1998) continues to govern judicial appointments.

The 102nd Amendment (2018) gave constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) by inserting Article 338B. The NCBC was elevated from a statutory body to a constitutional body, similar to the National Commission for SCs and STs. It also inserted Article 342A empowering the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes for a State/UT. The Supreme Court in Maratha Reservation case held that the 102nd Amendment did not denude State Governments of power to identify backward classes.

---

The 105th Amendment (2021) restored the power of State Governments to identify and maintain their own lists of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs/OBCs). This was necessitated after the Supreme Court's Maratha Reservation judgment interpreted the 102nd Amendment as having taken away state powers. The amendment clarified that the Central list under Article 342A is only for central purposes, and states retain power to identify OBCs for state reservations.

The 106th Amendment (2023), known as Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, provides for reservation of one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. One-third of seats reserved for SCs and STs will also be reserved for women. The reservation will come into effect after delimitation based on the first Census conducted after commencement of this Amendment. The reservation will be for a period of 15 years, with provision for Parliament to extend. Rotation of seats will be determined after each delimitation exercise. This historic amendment was first proposed as the Women's Reservation Bill in 1996 and took 27 years to pass.
