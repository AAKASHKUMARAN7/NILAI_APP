Any law referred to in Article 2 or Article 3 shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the First Schedule and the Fourth Schedule as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law and may also contain such supplemental, incidental and consequential provisions as Parliament may deem necessary.

Parliament may by law indemnify any person in the service of the Union or of a State for any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area within India where martial law was in force.

Martial law effectively suspends ordinary civil governance in a specific area.

Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws for prescribing punishment for acts declared as offences under Part III (e.g., untouchability under Article 17, trafficking under Article 23) and for giving effect to certain rights like the right against self-incrimination. This concentrates certain legislative competence in Parliament to ensure uniformity of penal provisions relating to fundamental rights across India.
